# projectOne-GA

Welcome to my game, ConnectFour for America!

Directions:
-Players enter their names and are assigned to one of two sides.

-Players then take turns dropping pieces into the board by clicking on a column at the top.

-When a column is clicked, that player's piece falls to the lowest available spot in the column.

-When a player connects four pieces, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally, that player wins!

Special thanks to the GA instructors for kicking butt and teaching me the tools to build this game.
